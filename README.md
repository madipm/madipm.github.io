Welcome to the Tudor History Twine Story GitHub repository! This is an interactive narrative that
was created using Twine, a tool used for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.
In this particular Twine story, we focus on Tudor history.
More specifically, we focus on the life of a noblewoman who mirrors the experiences of Queen Elizabeth I.
